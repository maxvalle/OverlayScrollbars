# OverlayScrollbars
A Xojo class to emulate OS X 10.7+ overlay scrollbars on Listbox

Since the Xojo Listbox is not a native control, it can't display overlay scrollbars in OS X 10.7+.

This class emulate it with a Canvas subclass.
Simply drag OverlayScrollbars over a listbox to automatically have better looking scrollbars.
